# Point
Starter mini-project to introduce the concept of Python classes and objects

Download this repository to your working computer to create a directory (folder) 
in which to do your work.  The file test_point.py is provided for you.  You 
create file point.py.  The test cases are designed to be run after each little 
bit of work on point.py.  

If you encounter difficulty, there are several ways to get help: 

* Use our Piazza site to post a question.  (Also, search it to see if a relevant question and answer has already been posted.)  Our Piazza site is piazza.com/uoregon/winter2019/cis211/home .  

* Ask your teaching assistant during your scheduled lab hour, after completing the lab exercise. 

* Come to open lab hours (to be posted) and ask any of our learning assistants or a classmate.
